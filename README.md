# PythonTrafficSimulator [in progress]
Python Traffic Simulator implements the Intelligent Driver Model to simulate basic 2 dimensional traffic from a top-down perspective. 

## Intelligent Driver Model:
The intelligent driver model uses two ordinary differential equations to define the movement of each car in the system.

In my project, these ODES are solved using the 3rd-order Range-Kutta method.
